# Linux-Guides
This repo is where I keep my Linux Guides for Arch Linux, Gentoo, etc.

These are basic txt documents that you can download for use when installing or setting up.

If you want to make a change, go ahead and fork the repo.

If you want to merge the changes into the original guides create a pull request and if it's good I might merge it.
