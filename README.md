This repo is where I keep my Linux Guides for Arch Linux, Gentoo, etc.

These are basic txt documents that you can download for use when installing or setting up.

I don't need to explain how to download the repo. git clone it, view it on github, etc.

Note that I have been writing these guides since the start of 2022 but didn't upload it to github until I verified that the guides didn't have any mistakes and/or critical changes made upstream.

If you want to make a change, go ahead and fork the repo and then create a pull request and if the change is benefitial I might merge it into the master branch.
