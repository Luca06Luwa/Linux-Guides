These guides were made using elements from various different places. List of guides and credits for those guides are listed here. (Just wanted to give credit where credit is due).

Note that not all of these guides are from other people. I had to change quite a bit so that there wouldn't be any errors when following them and update the package names as alot of them have been changed/removed.
